== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The submit button doesnt work? =
You have javascript errors on your theme either from the theme itself or an installed plugin. You can troubleshoot this by hitting F12 and checking the browser console.

= Why is the user-interface not displaying correctly? =
Your theme's style.css might be interfering with the default css of the plugin. To customize the way the plugin is displayed in your theme either create styles overwriting the the styles called from /X Forms/css/ui.css or customize /X Forms/css/ui.css to suit your theme. 
This plugin was developed following WP best practice and will work best with themes thats developed using the same standards.

= The form element does not convert into the actual field on dropping =
Unfortunately this is one bug that simple wont die
If you drag a form element onto the canvas area (center column) it sometimes does'nt convert into the actual field. This happens mostly if the element is dropped at the very top or bottom of the form. Just drag and drop it little, almost shaking it until it converts. 

= Is there any documentation for this plugin? =
Yes, go to /X forms/documentation/index.html

= How do I make suggestions or report bugs for this plugin? =

== Why X Forms ==

We created [X Forms](http://codecanyon.net/item/x-forms-wordpress-form-creator-plugin/5214711?ref=Basix), where X=Any, because we got sick of trying to find the perfect form builder. From the knowledge we gathered from all the form builders that came short we came up with this, [X Forms](http://codecanyon.net/item/x-forms-wordpress-form-creator-plugin/5214711?ref=Basix)...and we share it with you!
