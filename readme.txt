All forms and their settings are immediately accessible by a single click.

* Background: change the form element's background color
* Padding: change the space between the form element border inwards (left right, bottom, top)
* Margin: change the space between the form element border outwards (left, right, bottom, top)
* Border: change the border style as solid, dashed or dotted, change the border thickness and change the border color

= 2.1.0 =
* First release 

= 2.1.0 =
* Fixed drag and drop

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The submit button doesnt work? =
You have javascript errors on your theme either from the theme itself or an installed plugin. You can troubleshoot this by hitting F12 and checking the browser console.

= Why is the user-interface not displaying correctly? =
Your theme's style.css might be interfering with the default css of the plugin. To customize the way the plugin is displayed in your theme either create styles overwriting the the styles called from /X Forms/css/ui.css or customize /X Forms/css/ui.css to suit your theme. 
This plugin was developed following WP best practice and will work best with themes thats developed using the same standards.

= The form element does not convert into the actual field on dropping =
Unfortunately this is one bug that simple wont die
If you drag a form element onto the canvas area (center column) it sometimes does'nt convert into the actual field. This happens mostly if the element is dropped at the very top or bottom of the form. Just drag and drop it little, almost shaking it until it converts. 

= Is there any documentation for this plugin? =
Yes, go to /X forms/documentation/index.html

= How do I make suggestions or report bugs for this plugin? =
Email questions, bugs and suggestions to pluginsexpress@webaways.com

== Using X Forms == 

= Layout =

* Left hand column: Contains all fields grouped into 4 sections (click on the headings to toggle through). Drag them to the canvas area and drop.
* Centre column: The very top contains all forms next to the "New Form" tab. Click on the tabs to switch forms. Next is the form title, form actions (duplicate and delete), Viewing tabs (Build, Design, Form Entries and Code), and then we have the actual form canvas where elements can be dropped, sorted (drag up or down) or removed (click on the X top right corner of the field).
* Right hand column: When in "build" view this contains General settings, Email Setup, Form Layout and Color schemes(themes). When in "Design" view this contains The Visual Editor, Form Layout and Color schemes(themes). Click on these to toggle hide and show.
* Using the Visual Editor: When in design view you will notice the visual editor on the right hand column. You can change a all of a single form element's style attributes by clicking on it or you can change specific elements types as a whole by using the dropdown labelled (Overall styling selections)

= Field settings =

* Editing field settings: After a field has been dropped into the canvas, hover over it and you will notice a few links popup. Click on edit settings to customize the field title, error message (shown if required, or pre-formatted) and help text. If the hower state get switched around just click on current form tab agian.
* Editing Field titles, paragraphs and heading: Just click on them, enter the desired name and hit enter or click somewhere away from the field.
* Radio and Check groups, Dropdowns, Autocomplete, Upload file and Date-picker fields:</strong></em> These have settings unique to theme. you will finsd it by hover over the field.

== Why X Forms ==

We created [X Forms](http://codecanyon.net/item/x-forms-wordpress-form-creator-plugin/5214711?ref=Basix), where X=Any, because we got sick of trying to find the perfect form builder. From the knowledge we gathered from all the form builders that came short we came up with this, [X Forms](http://codecanyon.net/item/x-forms-wordpress-form-creator-plugin/5214711?ref=Basix)...and we share it with you!
